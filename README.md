# Geographically Weighted Regression Modeling on Life Expectancy in East Java

Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a method of regression analysis for data that violates the assumption of homoscedasticity or spatial heterogeneity conditions. The preliminary study shows that the Life Expectancy Data of districts or cities in East Java Province in 2021 contains spatial heterogeneity. The aim of the research is to obtain the best Geographically Weighted Regression model among 4 weights kernel functions include fixed kernel gaussian, fixed kernel bi-square, adaptive kernel gaussian, adaptive kernel bi-square on factors affecting Life Expectancy in East Java Province in 2021
